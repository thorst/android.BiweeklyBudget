# android.BiweeklyBudget

## About

I just want a simple and clean app to keep track of my budget. I get paid every other week and allot myself X amount of dollars. I use cash and credit throughout the two weeks and need a ledger to track all of those expenses.

You could also use this app if you have several savings accounts, such as car fund, college fund, etc, and want to keep track of those accounts.

Some purposefully absent features:
*  No categories or unneeded data entry
*  No charts or pretty but useless tools to waste screenspace
*  No ads to annoy you
*  No required access to your phone
*  No required access to the internet
*  No access to your online banks or credit cards
